# Phonebook App

This app is a homework at GoIT school. There were used functional components
with hooks, Styled Components, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query

- adding new contacts
- filter by name
- deleting contacts
- Redux store + RTK Query (fetch, post, delete data (contacts) in DB)

This project was bootstrapped with
